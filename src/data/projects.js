I had to design custom soft jaws and constantly adjust feed rates to prevent the stainless steel from work-hardening and destroying my carbide end mills. I first machined the whole watch out of acrylic, then Aluminum, then I needed to machine the stainless parts twice. Overall I remade the watch about 5 times, taking over 150 hours of machining.",
